# teensy_xinput_modifications
Added the modified Xinput dependencies to be uploaded and used in plaformio. 

Following the example from this solution thread: 
https://community.platformio.org/t/how-to-modify-teensy-core-files/7425/16

This repo is meant to be taken by platformio to replace the base libs used in Teensy to allow for Xinput
